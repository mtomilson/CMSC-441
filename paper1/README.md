## How To Run
gcc -o run gcd.cpp <br> ./run
<br>
## What it does: 
Implemented three different algorithms to calculate the greatest common factor of two given numbers and calculates the <br>
amount of divisions required per algorithm and the amount of time it takes to execute. 

## The algorithms: 
Euclid's Algorithm, Prime Factorization algorithm, and an Iterative algorithm 

## Time complexities:
Euclid's: O(log n) <br>
Prime Factorization: O(âˆšn) <br>
Iterative Algorihtm: O(n)
